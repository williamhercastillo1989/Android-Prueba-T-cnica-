## Project Overview
This project leverages modern Android development tools and frameworks, including:
- **Hilt** for dependency injection.
- **Dagger** for advanced DI scenarios.
- **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for clean separation of concerns.
- **Retrofit** for network operations.
- **Coroutines** for asynchronous programming.
- Common design patterns like Repository, Singleton, and Factory for scalable and maintainable code.

---

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (latest stable version)
- Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or higher)
- A physical or virtual Android device (API level 21 or higher)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.
4. Configure an Android device/emulator.

## Dependencies
- **[Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt)**: Simplifies dependency injection.
- **[Dagger](https://dagger.dev/)**: Used for advanced DI scenarios.
- **[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)**: REST API client.
- **[Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)**: For managing asynchronous tasks.
- **[Jetpack Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)**: LiveData, ViewModel, Navigation, etc.
- **Gson**: For JSON serialization/deserialization.

## Development Guidelines
1. **Architecture:** Follow the MVVM pattern.
2. **Dependency Injection:** Use Hilt for injecting dependencies. Define modules in the `di/` package.
3. **Networking:** Use Retrofit for API calls. Define all API interfaces and Retrofit instances in the `data/` package.
4. **Asynchronous Programming:** Use Kotlin Coroutines for background tasks and LiveData for observing data changes.
5. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling at the repository level and propagate user-friendly messages to the ViewModel.
6. **Code Styling:** Adhere to Kotlin coding conventions and use consistent naming patterns.
7. **Unit Testing:** Write tests for ViewModels, repositories, and use mocked dependencies.

---

## Building and Running
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and Gradle is synced.
2. Select the desired build variant (e.g., debug, release).
3. Run the application using:
   - The "Run" button in Android Studio, or
   - Command line:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew assembleDebug
     ```

---

## Testing
1. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```
2. Run instrumentation tests:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
   ```
3. Mock dependencies for ViewModel and Repository testing using Dagger and Hilt.

---

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Follow the coding and architectural guidelines.
3. Commit changes with clear messages.
4. Submit a pull request for review.
